# Logistic Regression — Patron Subscription Renewal (Train + Score)

This project builds a **logistic regression** model in Python to predict whether a theater patron will **renew their season ticket subscription**, then applies the trained model to a separate scoring dataset to generate **predictions and probabilities**.

It is designed as a clean, reproducible **Python workflow** for classification and model interpretation, including:
- Ensuring `RenewedSubscription` is treated as a **binary (0/1)** label
- Retaining `PatronID` as an identifier (**not** a predictor)
- Range-checking scoring observations against training feature ranges (and removing out-of-range rows)
- Fitting a logistic regression model using **all predictors** (no feature removal)
- Exporting interpretability outputs (coefficients, p-values, odds ratios)
- Exporting evaluation artifacts (confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC)
- Writing an “evidence locker” of outputs (CSVs + PNG visuals) to `output/`

Notes

Thresholding uses 0.50 by default (ProbabilityRenew >= 0.50 → “Yes”).

Coefficients are in log-odds. Odds ratios are computed as exp(coefficient) to make feature effects easier to interpret.

The range-check step is a conservative guardrail against scoring inputs that fall outside the training data distribution.
